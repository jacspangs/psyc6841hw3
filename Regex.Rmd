Regex is a way of writing patterns to match a specific sequence of characters.

_Solution:_ `abc`

# Numbers

`\d` can be used in place of any digit from 0 - 9

preceding slash indicates metacharacter

_Solution:_ `123` or `\d` will capture all lines

# The Dot

`.` = wildcard (matches any single character, including whitespaces)

using a `.` searches everything, so if you're trying to find dots (periods) then you'd need to escape the `.` to indicate you actually want to match it. 

`\` = Escaping 

`\.` is an escaped dot that will find actual dots

_Solution:_ `...\.` - first three dots match any three characters and the final escaped dot captures the period after the three characters

# Matching specific characters

`[xxx]` = Match specific characters by adding square brackets  

_Solution:_ To match can, man, fan but not dan, ran, pan use `[cmf]` to match any of the first three letters

# Excluding specific characters

`[^]` Adding a "hat" in the square bracket will match any single character *except* for the characters you specify in the bracket

_Solution:_ Simplest  to match any line that ends in 'og' but is not 'bog' would be the expression `[^b]og`

Alternatively, use `[hd]og` to match 'hog' and 'dog' but not 'bog'. (slightly more restrictive expression because it limits the strings it can match)

# Character ranges

`-` = indicate a character range and match a character in list of sequential characters  

`[0-6]` will only match any single digit character from zero to six, and nothing else. 

`[^n-p]` will only match any single character except for letters n to p.

`\w` = metacharacter that matches all text and numbers in English. Equivalent to the character range `[A-Za-z0-9_]` 

Multiple character ranges can also be used in the same set of brackets, along with individual characters. 

_Solution:_ `[A-Z][a-z][a-z]` works. More specifically could use `[A-C][n-p][a-c]` 

# Repetitions

`\d\d\d` would match exactly three digits

`a{3}` = match a three times - curly braces can provide the number of times you want a character to match. 

`a{1,3}` = match the a character no more than 3 times, but no less than once

`w{3}` = three w's

`[wxy]{5}` = five characters, each of which can be a w, x, or y 

`.{2,6}` = between two and six of any character

_Solution:_ `z{2}` or more specifically `waz{3,5}up`

# Kleene Star/Plus, Unknown lengths

`\d*` = match any number of digits

`\d+` = ensures that the input string has at least one digit 

`a+` = one or more a's

`[abc]+` = one or more of any a,b, or c character

`.*` = zero or more of any character

_Solution:_ `[a,b,c]{2}` got me there. 
 
`aa+b*c+` to represent exactly

`a{2,4}b{0,4}c{1,2}` which puts both an upper and lower bound on the number of each of the character (most restrictive)

# Optional Characters 

`?` = metachacater that denotes optionality. Matches either zero or one of the preceding character or group

`ab?c` matches `abc` or `ac`

Must escape `\?` the mark if you're trying to match the symbol itself 

_Solution:_ `\d+ files? found\?`

# Whitespace

`(‚ê£)` = space

`(\t)` = tab 

`(\n)` = new line  

`(\r)` = carriage return (useful in Windows envs)

`\s` = whitespace special character that will match any of the above specific whitespaces (useful in raw input text)

_Solution:_ `[1,2,3]\.\s+abc` - more specific

`\d\.\s+abc` - suggested solution, more general

# Starting & Ending

Writing very specific expressions guards against false positives

`^` & `$` are metacharacters to denote start and end of line. This hat differs from the != hat found in brackets. 

`^success` - only matches a line that begins with the word success. Would not match "Error: unsuccessful operation."

_Solution:_ `^Mission: successful$` matches a full string that starts with Mission and ends with successful. 

# Match Groups

`()` = parentheses define groups of characters. Subpatterns inside parentheses are captured as a group. 

Useful for extracting information, like phone numbers, from large sets of data

`^(IMG\d+\.png)$` = captures a full filename
`^(IMG\d+)\.png)$` = only capture part before the period

_Solution:_ `^(file_.+)\.pdf$` - starts with file_, then anything as a group, before ending in a .pdf

# Nested Groups

Generally, results of captured groups are in the order in which they are defined 

Nested groups are read left to right in the pattern

`^(IMG(\d+))\.png$ ` = using a nested parenthesis to capture the digits -- i.e. if a list of image files had a sequential picture number in the filename, you could extract both the filename and the picture number using the same pattern by writing an expression like

_Solution:_ `^((\w{3})\s(\d{4}))` My solution, pretty specific

Suggested solution - `(\w+ (\d+))`

### Nested Groups Cont'd

star *, plus +, repetition {m,n} and the question mark ? can all be used within the capture group patterns. This is the only way to apply quantifiers on sequences of characters instead of the individual characters themselves.

For example, if I knew that a phone number may or may not contain an area code, the right pattern would test for the existence of the whole group of digits (\d{3})? and not the individual characters themselves (which would be wrong).

_Solution:_ `^(\d+)x(\d*)` < same as suggested, except they used d+ in both. 

# Conditionals

`|` = pipe / logical denotes different possible sets of characters

`Buy more (milk|bread|juice)` would match Buy more milk, Buy more bread, or Buy more juice

Can use any sequence of characters or metacharacters

`([cb]ats*|[dh]ogs?)` would match either cats or bats, or, dogs or hogs. 

_Solution:_ `I love (cats|dogs)`

# Other Special Characters

`\D` = any non-digit character

`\S` = any non-whitespace character

`\W` = any non-alphanumeric character (such as punctuation)

`b` = matches the boundary between a word and a non-word character. Most useful in capturing entire words (eg. `\w+\b`)

Back referencing:
`\0` (usually the full matched text), `\1` (group 1), `\2` (group 2), etc. 

Useful in a text editor, doing a search and replace using regular expressions to swap two numbers, you can search for "(\d+)-(\d+)" and replace it with "\2-\1" to put the second captured number first, and the first captured number second for example.

_Solution:_ `.*` captures everything = lazy solution


# Practice Problems

1. Varying constructions of numbers (scientific, commas, periods, etc)
`^-?\d+(,\d+)*(\.\d+(e\d+)?)?$` will match a string that starts with an optional negative sign, one or more digits, optionally followed by a comma and more digits, followed by an optional fractional component which consists of a period, one or more digits, and another optional component, the exponent followed by more digits.

2. Phone numbers
`\(?(\w{3})\)?-?\s?\w{3}-?\s?\w{4}` My solution to capture telphone numbers, including grouping area codes

*Recommended solution*
To grab the area code from the phone numbers, we can simply capture the first three digits, using the expression (\d{3}).

However, to match the full phone number as well, we can use the expression `1?[\s-]?\(?(\d{3})\)?[\s-]?\d{3}[\s-]?\d{4}`. This breaks down into the country code '1?', the captured area code '\(?(\d{3})\)?', and the rest of the digits '\d{3}' and '\d{4}' respectively. We use '[\s-]?' to catch the space or dashes between each component.

3. Email addresses
`^([\w\.]*)` - extracts beginning of each email up to a special character, where "." is not a special character because it is included in the syntax. Stops at @ or +

4. HTML tags
`<(\w*)` captures opening tags

You can also capture tag contents `>([\w\s]*)<` or even attribute values `='([\w://.]*)"` if desired (not the goal of this problem though).

5. Matching File Names
`(\w+)\.(jpg$|png$|gif$)` - my solution says grab characters in a group, then a dot, then anything that ends $ in jpg, png, gif

I could have put $ at the end of group: `(\w+)\.(jpg|png|gif)$`

6. Trimming whitespace from start/end line
`^\s*(.*)\s*?$` My solution says starts with whitespace, capture anything in group, then find whitespace at end

Solution -- We can just skip all the starting and ending whitespace by not capturing it in a line. For example, the expression `^\s*(.*)\s*$` will catch only the content.

7. Extracting info from log file
`^[W|E]/\(\s1553\):\s*at widget.List.(makeView|fillDown|fillFrom)\((ListView\.java):(\d*)\)` -- ugly, but works! 

This one can be tricky too, but we really just want to capture the method name, filename, and line number. This can be achieved using the expression (\w+)\(([\w\.]+):(\d+)\) in which the first capture group is the method, followed by an escaped parenthesis, followed by the filename, a colon, and finally the line number.

8. Parsing & extracting URL data

We have to match each of the three components:

- the protocols in our list are all alphanumeric, so they can be matched using `(\w+)://`

- The hosts can contain non-alphanumeric characters like the dash or the period, so we will have to specifically include those characters using `://([\w\-\.]+)`

- The port is an optional part of the URI and is preceeded with a colon and can be matched using `(:(\d+))`

To put it all together, we then have the full regular expression `(\w+)://([\w\-\.]+)(:(\d+))?` to capture all the data we are looking for.
